                        Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Jazz, and I was born in the beautiful city of Kuching. I graduated with MEng (Hons) in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from the University of Nottingham. Currently, I reside in Malaysia and am immersed in my career journey within the semiconductor industry, and now with SAINS. But life isn't all work for me, I have a deep passion for sports and an array of hobbies that keep me energized, including swimming, exploring scenic hiking trails, and hitting the gym to stay fit and active. Music is another significant part of my life, and I express my creativity through playing the piano and guitar. I also enjoy exploring new horizons, and my adventures have led me to create a YouTube music channel where I share my original compositions and musical creations. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you have a wonderful day ahead!

                                    <li>Optimal Design for Grid-connected Solar Power System project under Household Electrification aims to analyze the technical and economical for the on and off-grid PV systems along with the 3D shading models in a case study to provide the reader with a better comprehensive vision of incorporating both on and off-grid PV system with a suitable designation. As a result, two case study scenarios of the PV solar plant have been performed in each of the on and off-grid PV systems based on the demands of users with a total power required at 13144276 kWh/day on the residential area filled with two hundred and eighty houses, a clubhouse, a large control house and a swimming pool on the targeted location at Metropolitan Area, Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia. Thus, there are four scenarios forecasted for investigation in a year. Detailed simulations are done in PVsyst, and financial models are used to compare different systems and their viability</li>
                                    <li>A 2D/3D shading model design is sketched to develop the most optimal solar plant system for the residential area. In doing so, suitable engineering drawings are generated which are detailed enough to construct the system. Detailed costs with quotes from relevant manufacturers and suppliers become instrumental in determining the balance of system costs and total project costs. The final simulated result is preferred on the Tracking Tilted Axis (TTA) with an on-grid PV system with a PV capacity of 4797 MWh and an inverter output high up to 4.08 kWh/kWp/day. Following that, the PV system has a weighted Performance Ratio (PR) of 0.810. Over the project period of 20 years, the PV system can achieve the annual Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) at 0.71 MYR/kWh, which is significantly lower than the previewed research papers and journals from the researchers in the thesis writing. With that, a net present value (NPV) and return of investment (ROI) of 33580,078.53 MYR, and 75.5%, respectively, without incentives</li>

                                    <li>The smart Sun Tracking System project aims to build a smart sun tracking system based on many aspects. Solar energy technologies have become one of the high-performance solutions of energy providers in this modern technological age. It uses sunlight and turns it into electricity without causing waste, the greenhouse effect, or other substances that might affect the environment. A smart sun solar tracking system is a PV panel with a mechanism that monitors the Sun's vision with greater efficiency than a standard PV panel. This project presented the basic concept of a smart sun solar tracking device and a list of technology specifically to give the reader a better understanding and vision of incorporating a smart sun tracker with a suitable designation for this project</li>
                                    <li>All the results of different tracking systems that have been theoretically simulated when considering several points of view have been studied and compared to enhance the tracking system in the future prototype. Considering costs and usages based on position in Malaysia, a remarkable single-axis PV tracker with a tilted axis tracking system is discovered, among other things. Apart from that, the tracking device chosen is because it has a better sun path because Malaysia is so near the equator that the Sun's position between summer and winter solstice is not as different as in places farther up the northern or southern hemisphere. Furthermore, the tilted tracker's annual output is approximately 21.1MWh, with a fixed amount of 1908 kWh/kWp/year production, which is sufficient to support residential use. This study uses a simulation software model to investigate the smart sun-tracking method of a photovoltaic electrical installation. As a result, this model estimates the electrical photovoltaic generation and electrical exchanges using a residential with the standalone system for a given load profile and duration usage</li>

                                    <li>A radar speed gun, also known as a radar gun, speed gun, or speed trap gun, is a device used to measure the speed of moving objects. It is commonly used by police to check the speed of moving vehicles while conducting traffic enforcement, and in professional sports to measure speeds such as those of baseball pitches, tennis serves, and cricket bowls</li>
                                    <li>A radar speed gun is a Doppler radar unit that may be handheld, vehicle-mounted, or static. It measures the speed of the objects at which it is pointed by detecting a change in frequency of the returned radar signal caused by the Doppler effect, whereby the frequency of the returned signal is increased in proportion to the object's speed of approach if the object is approaching, and lowered if the object is receding.[3] Such devices are frequently used for speed limit enforcement, although more modern LIDAR speed gun instruments, which use pulsed laser light instead of radar, began to replace radar guns during the first decade of the twenty-first century, because of limitations associated with small radar systems</li>
